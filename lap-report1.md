# Lab Report 1 - Remote Access and FileSystem (Week 1)
Basic filesystem commands we learned in class 10/03/23
## Commands
* cd
	1. Share an example of using the command with no arguments

 		```console
		[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cd
		
		
		```

 * ls
	
 * cat
	1. Share an example of using the command with no arguments.

		```console
		[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cd
		
		
		```
  
		Working Directory:
		```console
		[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ pwd
		/home/lecture1
		```
	 	when running the 'cat' command with no arguments the command hangs and does not output anything. I had to use 'ctrl + c' to exit the command. The output is an error, the 'cat' command needs an argument since no argument was given, and there was nothing to cat out.
